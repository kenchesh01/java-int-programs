Q #3) Write a Java Program to swap two numbers using the third variable.

Answer: In this example, we have made use of the Scanner class to declare an object with a predefined standard input object. This program will accept the values of x and y through the command line (when executed).

We have used nextInt() which will input the value of an integer variable ‘x' and ‘y' from the user. A temp variable is also declared.

Now, the logic of the program goes like this – we are assigning temp or third variable with the value of x, and then assigning x with the value of y and again assigning y with the value of temp. So, after the first complete iteration, the temp will have a value of x, x will have a value of y and y will have a value of temp (which is x).

import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SwapTwoNumbers {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        int x, y, temp;
        System.out.println("Enter x and y");
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        x = in.nextInt();
        y = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Before Swapping" + x + y);
        temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
        System.out.println("After Swapping" + x + y);
         
    }
 
}
Output:

Enter x and y
45
98
Before Swapping4598
After Swapping9845



Q #4) Write a Java Program to swap two numbers without using the third variable.

Answer: Rest all things will be the same as the above program. Only the logic will change. Here, we are assigning x with the value x + y which means x will have a sum of both x and y.

Then, we are assigning y with the value x – y which means we are subtracting the value of y from the sum of (x + y). Till here, x still has the sum of both x and y. But y has the value of x.

Finally, in the third step, we are assigning x with the value x – y which means we are subtracting y (which has the value of x) from the total (x + y). This will assign x with the value of y and vice versa.

import java.util.Scanner;
  
class SwapTwoNumberWithoutThirdVariable
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      int x, y;
      System.out.println("Enter x and y");
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
  
      x = in.nextInt();
      y = in.nextInt();
  
      System.out.println("Before Swapping\nx = "+x+"\ny = "+y);
  
      x = x + y;
      y = x - y;
      x = x - y;
  
      System.out.println("After Swapping without third variable\nx = "+x+"\ny = "+y);
   }
}
Output:

Enter x and y
45
98
Before Swapping
x = 45
y = 98
After Swapping without a third variable
x = 98
y = 45
