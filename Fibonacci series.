Q #9) Write a Java Program for the Fibonacci series.

Answer: Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where after the initial two numbers, every occurring number is the sum of two preceding numbers.

For Example 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21………

In this program, we have used Scanner class again with nextInt (discussed above). Initially, we are entering (through command line) the number of times the Fibonacci has to iterate. We have declared integer num and initialized a,b with zero and c with one. Then, we have used for loop to iterate.

The logic goes like a is set with the value of b which is 0, then b is set with the value of c which is 1. Then, c is set with the sum of both a and b.

import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num, a = 0,b=0, c =1;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of times");
        num = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Fibonacci Series of the number is:");
        for (int i=0; i<num; i++) {
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = a+b;
            System.out.println(a + "");    //if you want to print on the same line, use print()
        }       
    }
}
Output:

Enter the number of times
10
Fibonacci Series of the number is:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
