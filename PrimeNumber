Q #7) Write a Java Program to find whether a number is prime or not.

Answer: Here, we have declared two integers temp and num and used Scanner class with nextInt(as we have integer only).

One boolean variable isPrime is set to true. Thereafter, we have used for loop starting from 2, less than half of the number is entered and incremented by 1 for each iteration. Temp will have the remainder for every iteration. If the remainder is 0, then isPrime will be set to False.

Based on isPrime value, we are coming to the conclusion that whether our number is prime or not.

import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Prime {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        int temp, num;
        boolean isPrime = true;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        num = in.nextInt();
        in.close();
        for (int i = 2; i<= num/2; i++) {
            temp = num%i;
            if (temp == 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(isPrime) 
            System.out.println(num + "number is prime");
            else
                System.out.println(num + "number is not a prime");
             
         
    }
 
}
Output:

445
445number is not a prime
