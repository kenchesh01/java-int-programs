Q #17) Write a Java Program to check Armstrong number.

Answer:  First of all we need to understand what Armstrong Number is. Armstrong number is the number which is the sum of the cubes of all its unit, tens and hundred digits for three-digit numbers.

153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

If you have a four-digit number lets say

1634 = 1*1*1*1 + 6*6*6*6 + 3*3*3*3 + 4*4*4*4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634

Now, in this program, we have a temp and integers declared. We have initialized c with value 0. Then, we need to assign the integer value which we are going to check for Armstrong (in our case, let us say 153). Then we have assigned our temp variable with that number which we are going to check.

Thereafter, we have used while conditional check where the remainder is assigned to a and the number is divided by 10 and assigned to n. Now, our c variable which was set to zero initially is assigned with c+(a*a*a). Suppose we have to evaluate a four-digit number then c should be assigned with c + (a*a*a*a).

Lastly, we have put an if-else statement for conditional checking where we have compared the value contained in c against temp(which has the actual number stored at this point). If it matches, then the number is Armstrong otherwise not.

class Armstrong{  
 public static void main(String[] args)  {  
   int c=0,a,temp;  
   int n=153;//It is the number to check Armstrong  
   temp=n;  
   while(n>0)  
   {  
   a=n%10;  
   n=n/10;  
    c=c+(a*a*a);  
    }  
    if(temp==c)  
    System.out.println("armstrong number");   
    else 
        System.out.println("Not armstrong number");   
   }  
}
Output:
armstrong numbe
